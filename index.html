            <h2>Game Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Each player has 9 coins.</li>
                <li>Players take turns placing their coins on the board's intersections.</li>
                <li>When a player forms a line of 3 adjacent coins (horizontal or vertical only, not diagonal), they can remove one of their opponent's coins. The opponent's coin cannot be part of a line.</li>
                <li>After all coins are placed, players take turns moving their coins to adjacent positions.</li>
                <li>When a player forms a new line by moving a coin, they can remove one of their opponent's coins.</li>
                <li>If all opponent coins are protected (part of lines), the turn is automatically skipped.</li>
                <li>A player wins when their opponent has fewer than 3 coins remaining or cannot make a valid move.</li>
